Plugin Boilerplate for DocPad
=============================

Rationale
---------

I have found a few docpad plugins to be formatted in a deprecated fashion. Due to DocPad being relatively new, and things in the build/extend/test cycle are bound to change, I found it a good idea to have a skeleton generate a boilerplate plugin. This saves me from copy/pasting from the tutorial on the website and adds some more friendliness for future plugin developers.

How to use
----------

To be fully operational without directory modifications or scripting, this skeleton needs to be shipped like all the other DocPad skeletons. Normally we'd tuck-away any plugins in `node_modules/` directory but this is not desirable in this case???????
